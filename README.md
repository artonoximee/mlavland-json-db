# MLAV.LAND Website - .json-based version

## Introduction

This repository is a JSON-based version of the [mlav.land](https://mlav.land/) website. The website uses .json files to store simple information and act as a database, and javascript to display it in both french and english. This is an experiment to understand web-oriented javascript.

## Limits

Since all the content is added by the javascript script once it is loaded, this website does not comply to accessibility standards. If the client's browser blocks the javascript file, or if it does not load it, the page will appear blank with no information at all. This website is not intended to be deployed as is, and is an experiment to understand web-oriented javascript.
