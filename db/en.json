  "description":"MLAV.LAND is a field of research, explorations, investigations, and productions about architecture and what we consider its neighbour practices.<br><br> We seek to explore decisive factors, to form a wide prospective landscape. From this set of explorations, we want to develop a vision of future-oriented problematics, already questioning our contemporary architectural practice.<br><br>The first researches in our work are all oriented toward this intention of probing beyond innovations and evolutions, in order to imagine their associated consequences, in terms of social, political, technological and cultural matter. It is obvious that these speculations can not be seen as predictions, but as parts of an imaginary that constitutes our common hopes and doubts for the future.<br><br>We believe that the problematics we are studying are revealing a present state of architecture and its associated fields. We are convinced of the diverse definition of reality, fed by a multiplicity of domains, measurements, dialogs, pushing us to try capturing a part of it.<br><br> Therefore, we are developing a diffuse research, allowing us to put our discoveries, explorations, and productions in a dialog through a rhizomatic space of autonomous and interconnected places ; composed of interests, attractions, studies, encounters, topics, authors, architects, works, buildings, and projects.<br><br> As architects, we want to define our practice through a wide spectrum that goes from the usual project-making process to more experimental medium as performances, installations, graphic and musical works, cinematographic and photographic productions. The position that we seek to achieve includes a never-ending process of inquiries, overlaying on top of each other, producing real and virtual spaces for experimentation and solutions.",
